Omg just stumbled outa the theater, popcorn dust still clinging to my sweater like stars—Fountain of Youth” is a fever dream. Honestly, where do I even begin? My back's killing me from those stiff seats, but worth it—mind exploded (or imploded??).

First thing, the scene with Olivia waking up in the 1920s Paris cafe...like, the colors were as if a drunken painter got really religious. Or lost. Maybe both. And then suddenly the jazz band gets into this surreal loop, like a vinyl skipping as the lights morph into some kind of glowing soup...was it meant to symbolize...age? Time? My brain felt like a messy art project. A part of my mind was still there when the credits rolled, something like an echo mixed with the crunch of popcorn, stale in my mouth.

> That random bit where Hector, the time-traveler, started monologuing to a tree (yes, an actual tree!) had me questioning my sanity. Was the tree wise and ancient or just really sassy? Felt a bit like that time we wandered through that abandoned carnival—a nightmare wrapped in a soft-focus daydream. And god, that soundtrack, like bees harmonizing in some cosmic opera. Perfectly maddening.

I was trying to remember if Jenny asked if she should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it. It feels stowed away in my brain like a sticky note I can't quite find. But, Jenny, no spoilers, okay? Just...brace yourself like you're about to bungee jump off a flying bread piece.

The theater was chaos once it ended, like a zoo during a thunderstorm, everyone's confusion unpeeling like a banana (do bananas even unpeel?). Lights burned holes in my eyeballs, I swear. For a second I thought I saw a character from the   winking at me in the crowd. Or was it just Stan from accounting who's got a penchant for trench coats?

Anyway, the ending, don't remember much besides it being more of a question than an answer, like a cat meowing existential riddles. I'm all for letting it marinate, but geez, my brain's on broil now.

int main() {
    nostalgia();
    dreams.arise();
    cout << Lost in the loop, til next time!;

And now I'm just sitting here, a ghost, still trying to process...or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥...the memories.
